Just enabled Apache2, HTTPS on Ubuntu at www.inova.pt

Created a client called sales.inova.pt using ubuntu nad created 3 users for email:
maria, miguel and jorge all with the same password using: Passw0rd
Fixed my problem with miguel and jorge turns out I had to use different ports because Thunderbird changed its layout.

Created manuel user at central for to use for NFS

NIS is working on ubuntu inova.pt!

Email, NIS and NFS are working at Ubuntu's side.

HTTPS is neabled using nginx

As you can see from this report, I managed to get most things running, some things of redhat I did not manage to make them work because we mostly worked on Debian

But I managed to get Nginx on Redhat to work!!!

I hope I can improve my skills at programming and I hope I can understand a little bit better whe world of technology around me.

This project without my teacher and colleagues would be impossible so I have to thank them for helping me out!!  üëç
